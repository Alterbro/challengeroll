      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This is randomizer for Saturday challenge(but you can do it whenever you wish).
        The logic is simple: <br>
        >Roll your party <br>
        >Post what you get <br>
        >Setup party <br>
        >Try to beat the free quest "Dewar" or "Infinitude Territory" <br>
        >Post result <br>
        See rules for details and more challenging aproach. 
        P.S Design is shit, but at least it is usable.
      </p>
