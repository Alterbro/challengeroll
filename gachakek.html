      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        This is randomizer for Saturday challenge(but you try it whenever you wish).
        The logic is simple: <br>
        >Roll your party <br>
        >Post what you get <br>
        >Setup party <br>
        >Try to beat the free quest "Dewar" or "Infinitude Territory" <br>
        >Post result <br>
        Read the rules for details and for more challenging aproach. 
        P.S Design is shit, but at least it is usable.
      </p>

        <li>Free Quest: "Dewar" or "Infinitude Territory", unless you still didn't clear LB4.</li>
        <li>Having 4-5* servant in party is not allowed. Unless you can't make party full of 1-3 star Servants, then you can do randomizer with 4* servants.</li>

        <li>Mash is not allowed, unless it's Support Servant with very low lvl. </li>
        <li>Your servants have to be MAX ascension. (But feel free to try without MAX ascension).</li>
        <li>Level of skillset doesn't matter, as well as the final level of the servant. Grailed servants allowed.</li>
        <li>Post roll screen with party setup in the thread, play it, then post result(even fail).</li>
        <li>Rerolls are allowed if you got Mash for some unfixed reason, or if you got Servants that you don't have.</li>
        <li>If you are rolling 4/5 Star Servant gacha, and you don't have 4/5* Servant that you rolled, reroll only for another 4/5 Start Sevant without changing other servants in your party.</li>
